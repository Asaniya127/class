JVM:- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a part of the Java software that runs Java programs. It takes the compiled Java code (called bytecode) and converts it into machine code so your computer can understand and run it.

JRE:- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) in simple language:

The JRE is a part of Java that lets your computer run Java programs.

JAVA COMPILER:- Java Compiler (in simple language):

A Java Compiler is a special program that changes your Java code (written by you) into a language that the computer can understand.

JIT	Just-In-Time Compiler
Role	Converts bytecode â†’ machine code
Benefit	Faster execution at runtime

Datatypes:- the values a variable can store and how much memory it uses. there are two types of datatypes :- Primitive and Non Primitive type

Primitive type:- char,boolean,int,float,double,long.
Non Primitive :-string,array,classes,interfaces.

small size datatype is boolean as size is 1 bit.
large size datatype is long and double.
boxing:- Boxing means converting a primitive type (like int, char, double, etc.) into its object type (like Integer, Character, Double, etc.).

Unboxing:- Unboxing means converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type.
Integer a = 10;    // Wrapper class (Boxing happens here)
int b = a;         // Unboxing happens here
System.out.println(b);  // Output: 10
